# Win-Sc-utility
This is how I quickly take screenshots. If you have any better idea, please let me know, since this has been bothering me for years 🤔😐

Uses a simple windows batch script to anonymously open the very useful and beautiful nircmd application and ask it to take screenshot and save it to a folder.
I use it to take notes from my online class. 
I couldn't use any key mappings, because I was already using all the keys on my board.

Required:
Nircmd windows application

Initially I planned to write a vb script for pressing Windows and Printscreen key to take sc and save it in screenshots folder, but I couldn't find the keycode for start button.
That'd be better idea I guess, since it won't then need the help of any 3rd party application.
